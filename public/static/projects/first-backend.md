# About the project

This is an express web server which uses MongoDB to store my project/skills data. It powers this portfolio website. It can handle authentication for admin users. This way, I can create users who can edit projects and any other stuff that is on the website right now. This was a really nice project to learn about backend stuff, and basic user authentication.

# Technologies
