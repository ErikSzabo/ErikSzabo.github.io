This is my portfolio website. I will use this to show my work in the future
and it's also a good project to show off, because it tells to people what I'm
capable of with React right now.

## Contact form

Contact form currently using Google Apps Scripts to handle e-mails. It's nice
beacuse without a server, user must have to open a mail client to send e-mails
from a HTML form. However, right now, the only thing that user needs to do in order to send me an email, is to press the send button. I achieved this with google apps scripts, an with its MailApp api.

## Worth mentioning

On the website design, https://fireship.io, had a huge influence. I really like how that website looks.
