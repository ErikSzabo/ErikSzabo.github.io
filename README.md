This is my portfolio website. I will use this to show my work in the future
and it's also a good project to show off, because it tells to people what I'm
capable of with React right now.

## Who needs servers

This website doesn't use a server, or at least, not on my computer, beacuse it's
served via github pages. Right now I'm a student, so I don't really have money,
to run any servers, or anything that is not free. Maybe in the future I will
implement some serverless functionality for dynamic data retrieving and stuff.

## Contact form

Contact form currently using Google Apps Scripts to handle e-mails. It's nice
beacuse without a server, user must have to open a mail client to send e-mails 
from a HTML form. However, right now, the only thing that user needs to do in order to send me an email, is to press the send button. I achieved this with google apps scripts, an with its MailApp api.

## Worth mentioning

On the website design, https://fireship.io, had a huge influence. I really like
how that website looks, and they had an open source navigation, which I started to use.

The theme switcher at the top right corner is coming from https://logotar.schdesign.hu/. Check them out, they make really awesome design stuff.

I only used these resources, beacuse this site mainly aims to show off what can I do with React right now, and not my CSS skills.
