# Personal portfolio

This is my portfolio website. I will use this to show my work in the future
and it's also a good project to show off, because it tells to people what I'm
capable of with React right now.

# Frontend

This repo is my frontend, hosted via Github Pages. It's using all kind of **React** stuff, although I still have to finish some things, like cleanups, some optimization, and adding support for SEO.

# Backend

My backend is powered by **express**.
It can handle **authentication** and **CRUD** functionality for projects and "skills". I used **MongoDB** for the database, because it's a small project, and I value my time enough to not to go with some super amazing SQL.

## Worth mentioning

On the website design, https://fireship.io, had a huge influence. I really like how that website looks.
