			<Skill name="JavaScript" fill="80" logo={jsLogo}>
				<p>
					This was my really first language that I learnt. I have really strong emotions about this language,
					both good and bad, for reasons. I used it first with{' '}
					<span class="text-highlight">static sites</span>, then I moved to{' '}
					<span class="text-highlight">electron</span>, and now, here I am, using{' '}
					<span class="text-highlight">react</span>.
				</p>
			</Skill>

			<Skill name="CSS" fill="60" logo={cssLogo}>
				This amazing style language... Well, I need this everywhere. It's my biggest enemy, when it comes to
				websites. But... everyone can improve over time ðŸ˜ƒ
			</Skill>

			<Skill name="Python" fill="50" logo={pyLogo}>
				There aren't any developer who didn't tried python at least once. But this time it's different. I fell
				in love with <span class="text-highlight">pygame</span> and especially with the{' '}
				<span class="text-highlight">sockets</span> module.
			</Skill>

			<Skill name="Java" fill="40" logo={javaLogo}>
				Java is like fresh air with its static typing after python and other dynamic languages. I really loved
				it, although I just only used it in the 2nd semester.
			</Skill>

			<Skill name="Git, GitHub" fill="60" logo={gitLogo}>
				I've always used git with almost all of my projects. I'm familiar with the{' '}
				<span class="text-highlight">basic commands</span> and with <span class="text-highlight">branches</span>,
				however I haven't really done merges and rebase.
			</Skill>

			<Skill name="React" fill="40" logo={reactLogo}>
				Ever since I started web development I've always wanted to try <span class="text-highlight">react</span>.
				Now I'm really using it, and it's amazing!
